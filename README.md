# Modern Scroll - A 2025 Redesign of the Site C Movement App

## Overview (Nov. 2024)
- Ben Cox originally created this Shiny application in Aug 2022 in R using a monolithic code structure with a few tabs and photos. LGL had continued to use this app up until [Oct. of 2024 (v1.0.0)](https://github.com/LGLLimited/SiteC_MovementVis_App/releases/tag/v1.0.0) because it was perfectly functional, although not very polished.
- Modern Scroll is the project name for the 2025 redesign of the Site C movement app UI to give it a more professional feel. It is called modern scroll as it will remove the Shiny tabs of the [v1.0.0](https://github.com/LGLLimited/SiteC_MovementVis_App/releases/tag/v1.0.0) version and replace it with a single page that you scroll down through.
- It will continue to use the same monolith structure rather than trying to modularize the entire app for the sake of time. All interactive maps should function the same. 
## Credits
- The UI design (including the HTML, CSS, and JS) is based on the ["uber_shiny"]((https://github.com/vivekkatial/uber_shiny?tab=readme-ov-file)) application by user vivekkatial on [GitHub](https://github.com/vivekkatial).
  - Their Shiny application is actually based on a [Colorlib](https://colorlib.com/wp/) HTML template called ["Glint"] (https://colorlib.com/wp/template/glint/) by user Aigars Silkalns. From my understanding this is where most of the CSS and JS files are coming from.
